The Matrix Multiplication Proj Given by Sir

IDEA
A soon as we multiply one row of A, we can delete that row. So we allocate 1 more row for C and delete a row in A.

Therefore enough to alloc of A and B.

But, at a time only one row of A is used. Therefore Allocating Mem for B is enough.

UPDATE
Turning everything in Binary file implementations to increase speed and decrease space.

UPDATE
till N=2**12 implement normally
after that read in every row multiply and then write

UPDATE
Implemented Binary matrix I/P using octave's C-Style I-O functions but asnwers seems to have a large differnces ( i.e. even in the 10's place)
So going to use Octave and save in Text File, then convert the text file to binary file using C-Program.

Also implment Verify using Binary Files.
